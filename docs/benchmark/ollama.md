Ollama was quite disappointment.
It was easy to use, but not very flexible.

Also image size is relatively big - 4.58GB vs 1.59GB for onnx.

But the worst is performance of this framework.
it was clearly unable to take advantage for hardware acceleration for int8.

The performance was twice iller than onnx.
